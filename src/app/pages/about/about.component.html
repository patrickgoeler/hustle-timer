  <h3>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>
  <p>
    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
    <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/" target="_blank">
      Francesco Cirillo
    </a>
    in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into
    intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
    Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
    after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university
    student.

  <h3>Motivation for this App</h3>
  <p>
    I felt the need for a minimalistic pomodoro timer for both mobile and
    desktop devices. This Website is a Progressive Web App which means it can be
    installed on the homescreen and desktop.
